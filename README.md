# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restasurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This will be created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
